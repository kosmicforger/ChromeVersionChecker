# ChromeVersionChecker
Updates ChromeDriver Based on Current Google Chrome Browser Version

Chrome Version Checker 
- Automatically download the appropriate version of chromedriver from "https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/"
- Checks current version via registry "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\chrome.exe"
- Downloads zipped version of chromedriver, extracts it to executable directory
- Saves version.txt file to keep track of the last downloaded chromedriver version

Feel free to request changes or correct my mistakes!
